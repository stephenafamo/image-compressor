## About

This is a desktop app built with [Wails](https://wails.io/).  
It can be used to compress both JPEG and PNG images.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on <http://localhost:34115>. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
